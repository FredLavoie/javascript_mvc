## Javascript MVC To-Do App

This app is an exercise from [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/javascript-mvc-todo-app/). The purpose is to build a simple todo application using the MVC architecture pattern written in plain Javascript.

Model - manages the data, logic and rules of the application\
View - visual representation of the model\
Controller - controls the data flow from the user to the model and updates the view

Each component has been separated into it's own Javascript file and exported as a module. The app.js file combines the modules and instantiates an object which is itself exported as a module.
